Subject: Complaint: Service Outage and Support Issues
Date: Wed, 28 May 2025 14:22:37 +0000

Dear Customer Service,

I am writing to express my significant dissatisfaction with your services over the past week.

On May 25th, our entire system was down for approximately 5 hours (from 10:00 to 15:00 EST), which severely impacted our operations. Despite our Premium Support subscription, we waited for over 1 hour to speak with a support agent.

Issues that require immediate attention:
1. Recurring service outages (3 incidents this month)
2. Unacceptable support wait times
3. Lack of proactive notification for scheduled maintenance
4. Billing discrepancy on invoice #INV-2025-05789 ($499 overcharge)

As per our SLA, these issues constitute a violation of our agreement. We expect:
- A detailed explanation of the root causes
- Compensation for downtime as outlined in section 4.3 of our contract
- A remediation plan to prevent future occurrences
- Immediate resolution of the billing error

Our account details:
Account ID: TF-76589
Subscription tier: Premium Enterprise
Contract #: CT-2024-985412

I expect a response within 24 business hours, or we will be forced to escalate this matter and reconsider our business relationship.

Sincerely,
Sarah Smith
CTO, TechFirm Inc.
